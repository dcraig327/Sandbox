#44 words

#14 ch
#13 ch+num
#12 ch+num+sym


start with all lowercase
add uppercase
add numbers
add symbols



for a random sequency of lowercase, uppercase, and numbers composed of 13 characters
what is the entropy and how does that compare to the entropy in a word basedpassword
using brute force


start with all lowercase add uppercase add numbers for exactly 13 characters

26 + 26 + 10 = 62 ** 13
200,028,539,268,669,788,905,472
(13 characters with 1 3090 = 95,000 years)

goal: 100 years
